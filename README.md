# Sentiment Analysis Using LSTM
When you get in the driver’s seat of your car, are you able to just turn the engine on and drive away or do you need to think about how will you do it and each step of the process before leaving with the car? For most people, it’s the first option.That’s also how recurrent neural networks (RNNs) work. You don’t need to think from the scratch about every basic task you will do on your day because we have a little thing called memory, and so do the recurrent neural networks. 

RNNs have been applied with success to many kinds of natural language processing projects in the past few years. Those applications include speech recognition, language modeling, translation, and, of course, sentiment analysis. None of this would be possible without a special kind of RNN, and that is the LSTM (Long short-term memory). For many purposes, LSTMs work better than traditional recurrent networks.LSTM models are widely used nowadays, as they are particularly designed to have a long-term “memory” that is capable of understanding the overall context better than other neural networks affected by the long-term dependency problem.
